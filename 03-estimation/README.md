Emily Robinson, Susan VanderPlas, Reka Howard

# Experiment Name

+ Conducted: February 2022 - Present
+ Platform: [Shiny App]()
+ Recruitment Method: ISU Graphics Group, Reddit, Twitter, Direct Email, etc.
+ Trend Types: Simulated 3-Parameter Exponential

# Data Simulation
+ Two data sets were simulated with identical parameters. Data sets were randomly assigned to the scenarios.

*Algorithm: Exponential Data Generation* 

**In parameters:** 

**Out:** 

# Study Design

## Treatment Design

+ Scale
  + Linear
  + Log
+ Questions
  + Q0:
  + QE1:
  + QE2:
  + QI1:
  + QI2:
  + QI3:

## Experimental Design
+ Split plot RCBD: Linear/Log was assigned to the scenario (random order). Then Q0 was the initial question followed by the additional 5 questions in random orders.

# Data Files
+ Data file can be found in `estimation_data.db`.
+ Field descriptions can be found in [data-manifest.md](https://github.com/srvanderplas/Perception-of-Log-Scales/blob/master/estimation-development/estimation-pilot-app/data-manifest.md).
