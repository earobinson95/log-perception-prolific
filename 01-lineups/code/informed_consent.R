We are interested in whether people read information from charts accurately, and whether certain types of charts are more useful when making data-informed decisions. Unfortunately, we know relatively little about how people read and perceive charts. This study is designed to address this gap in research by systematically investigating the use of charts in different tasks and contexts. In order to participate you must be 18 years of age or older (19+ in Nebraska and Alabama, 21+ in Mississippi) and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision."),
